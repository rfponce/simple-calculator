# Simple Calculator

## Introduction

Simple Calculator is a program to make basic arithmetic calculations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as well as calculating percentages. Also, it can store values in memory, add and subtract them. 

## Usage

Input a value with the keypad on the screen or the physical keyboard, select an operator, enter the second value, then press = to make a calculation. If you want to delete the last value you can click on the C button or press the key C on the keyboard.

## Limitations

The display is limited to showing only 8 digits and a minus sign. If decimals are present they will be rounded to minimize the value to 8 digits. If the value is more than 8 digits the screen will show "NO SPACE".
