## Introduction

Simple Calculator is a program to make basic arithmetic calculations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as well as calculating percentages. Also, it can store values in memory, add and subtract them. 

## Usage

If you want to delete the last value entered you can click on the C button or press the key C on the keyboard.

### Percentages

To work with percentages enter a value, later an operator and then the percent button. Is not necessary to click on the equal button. By example: 1500, X button, 12, % button, will return 180. This operation can be made with the keyboard with the next sequence: 1500 * 12 %.
